  description="Stocker starts with a static site 
  powered by Eleventy. After digging a bit, I found there's a 
  subdomain with a login page that is running Express.js and is vulnerable to NoSQL Injection. 
  We bypass the aunthentication and log in to the site. 
  I'll exploit an unsanitized input that's being passed to a dynamic PDF that leads to a 
  file disclosure and use that to get source code of the application and find a hardcoded password and get a shell on the box.
  Inside the machine, we can abuse a path wildcard (*) and run node with sudo and get a root shell."

## Enumeration

### nmap

First we run [nmap](https://nmap.org/docs.html) to see what ports are open and what versions are running.

```shell
## Run a TCP SYN scan on all ports
nmap -p- -sS --min-rate 5000  --open -n -Pn 10.129.172.36
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-12 23:34 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.172.36
Host is up (0.23s latency).
Not shown: 33893 closed tcp ports (reset), 31640 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 23.84 seconds

## Detect versions of running services
nmap -sCV -p22,80 10.129.172.36
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-12 23:37 EDT

Host is up (0.073s latency).

```

### SITE

We see that it tries to redirect us to `http://stocker.htb` but it's not resolving. We'll add it to our `/etc/hosts` file and see what's there.

![Stocker](/images/htb-stocker-writeup/stocker-htb-mainsite.png)

All links on the site doesn't redirect except a few ones that points to another sections of the site. At the end, there's a staff section with **Angoose Garden** as the Head of IT at Stockers Ltd. We'll keep that in mind as a possible username.

Given the `stocker.htb` domain, I'll look for possibles subdomains with `gobuster`

#### Subdomain fuzzing

```shell
gobuster vhost -u http://stocker.htb -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --append-domain

```

We add `dev.stocker.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file

### DEV

In the dev site, we see a login page. A few guesses like `admin:admin` or `admin:password` doesn't work.

![Stocker Dev](/images/htb-stocker-writeup/dev-stocker-login.png)

We can see the headers of the site either with [Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) or with the curl command. We also see it's using nginx.

```shell
curl -s http://dev.stocker.htb/ -L -I

Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It's often used to build web applications and APIs, storing data in MongoDB databases. This is known as the [MEAN](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack#:~:text=The%20MEAN%20stack%20is%20a,a%20client%2Dside%20JavaScript%20framework) stack.
As the MongoDB team says:

> â€œThe MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN is named after MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node, the four key technologies that make up the layers of the stack."
