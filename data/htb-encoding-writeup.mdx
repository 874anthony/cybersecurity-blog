  description="MetaTwo starts with a simple WordPress blog using the BookingPress
        plugin to manage booking events. I’ll find an unauthenticated SQL
        injection in that plugin and use it to get access to the WP admin panel
        as an account that can manage media uploads. I’ll exploit an XML
        external entity (XXE) injection to read files from the host, reading the
        WP configuration, and getting the creds for the FTP server. On the FTP
        server I’ll find a script that is sending emails, and use the creds from
        that to get a shell on the host. The user has a Passpie instance that
        stores the root password. I’ll crack the PGP key protecting the password
        and get a shell as root."

## Enumeration

### nmap

First we run [nmap](https://nmap.org/docs.html) to see what ports are open. It's a good idea to run a full port scan, but in this case we are going to run a scan on the top 1000 ports.

```shell
nmap -p- --open -v 10.10.11.189 -oG initScan
```
